Project Milestone 5: Client-Server
Due Saturday, Apr 6th at 11:59pm

Building on your previous work, add Client-server model to your program. In this model Client
(task owner or vehicle owner) sends the data to VC Controller (server). VC Controller can
authorize the data to be stored on the file. There should be a button for VC Controller to Accept
or Reject. If the VC Controller rejects, the data will not be stored on the file.
The process is same for Vehicle Owner. Vehicle Owner sends the data to VC Controller (server).
If VC Controller accepts, the data will be stored on the file otherwise it wonâ€™t be stored.
Server should send the message to clients (Task Owner or Vehicle Owner) specifying the request
was accepted or rejected.

Note: You can have multiple frames representing Task Owner, Vehicle Owner and VC Controller.
